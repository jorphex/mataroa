    <h1>Custom Domain Guide</h1>
    <p>
        We offer custom domains with managed TLS (https) to users who pay for the
        Premium Plan.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up</h2>
    <p>
        Add an A record in your domain's DNS settings with IP:
    </p>
    <div>
        <code>95.217.30.133</code>
    </div>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        We only support <strong>one domain</strong>. This means that we cannot
        auto-redirect a naked domain (e.g. example.com) to its www version (i.e.
        www.example.com). To do this, you would need to choose one version and then
        host/serve/create some kind of redirect mechanism for the other version.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, take care to have "Proxied" turned
        off. This means that the setting should be in mode "DNS Only".
    </p>
    <p>
        Other things to try: dig, online DNS lookup tools, private/incognito mode,
        different browser, different computer/phone.
    </p>
